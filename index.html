  <div class="entry-content"><p>I survived to one of those fear cycles (and I still am surviving)</p>

<p>Probably the summary of how I managed to broke the cycle was accepting the defeat.</p>

<p>The first step was to publicly admit that we didn&rsquo;t knew we were breaking the system, even admitting that we didn&rsquo;t understood the whole system and the features that were included. When we accepted our lack of knowledge we allowed ourselves to be wrong.</p>

<p>We immediately started writing a system test plan with what we knew about the system. All our assumptions in just one place so we could get back there and just double check what we thought was right. This test plan grew as we broke the system when moving forward. Every time we broke something, we got back there and added a new test case of something we didn&rsquo;t knew before.</p>

<p>We also automated the tests that were just too extensive, too boring, or just low hanging fruit. This ended up building brittle tests, but at least that allowed us to double check that things were working as we assumed correctly.</p>

<p>Over time, the testing effort overtook the engineering effort, so we decided to dedicate a whole sprint to automating tests and got it back under control. Just by automating the test plan was enough.</p>

<p>Building confidence back bit by bit until the team felt that we had the situation under control allowed us to rebuild the parts of the system that were bringing most of the pain.</p>

<p>An important thing to mention is that the working environment has a &ldquo;rollback first&rdquo; culture. So every time we broke some functionality, we just rolled back, licked our wounds and started understanding what happened, why, and how do we prevent it from breaking again.</p>

<p>While being in the fear cycle we also accepted the challenge of delivering a big feature. The reason behind taking that challenge was to have an ambitious goal other than just a rewrite to force ourselves into breaking things, and to feel that we were going beyond just maintaining the system, or building the same thing again &ldquo;but this time doing it right&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This fear cycle is indeed a tricky place to be because of the mix of psychological and technical blend. It is hard to fight regressions all the time in legacy systems, and probably what matters the most is to just accept the defeat, and start again, treating the system as a legacy black box that we know nothing about.</p>

<p>There is a really interesting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrX_28s70ww">talk by Chad Fowler</a> about how they fixed the wunderlist infrastructure, they were just in this fear cycle. Initially they were so scared of breaking anything that they were just not deploying, so the first action was to release until it stopped hurting: &ldquo;if something hurts do it more often&rdquo;, which also applied to my case.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While reading Avdi Grimm&rsquo;s <strong>Exceptional Ruby</strong> he mentions:</p>

<p><em>Are Ruby Exceptions slow?</em></p>

<blockquote><p>Raising an exception is typically an expensive operation in any language,
and Ruby is no, um, exception</p></blockquote>

<p>Well, Python probably is no, um, exception either.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I was discussing about using exceptions for flow control myself
with my team. Probably influenced by <strong>Confident Ruby</strong> from the same author I
only like to see exception handling on the bottom edge of a method, not in the
middle.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post is neither about magical configurations, nor about baremetal IO ops,
nor about if you should move your database server to SSD. Neither it is about
fine tuning a MySQL server configuration, not even about how MySQL works as a
cluster.</p>

<p>This is about a single database server, this is about understanding how a MySQL
database works to lay the things in a way that it just works better. Bear with
me on this quick trip into MySQL performance degradation, we only need one
database, a few million records, and one query.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was on vacation, little to no connectivity, I just needed to learn something new: I needed to code something.</p>

<p>Using my phone I downloaded the source code from <a href="https://github.com/sjl/learnvimscriptthehardway/">learn VimScript the hard way</a>.</p>

<p>It was the book in markdown, but I did not wanted to read markdown, so I hacked a very simple
<a href="https://gist.github.com/pcarranza/da11a10e03c3ba1641ad#file-convert-sh">bash script</a>
to convert this markdown into html using <a href="https://github.com/davidfstr/rdiscount">rdiscount</a>
which happened to be installed in my laptop.</p>

<p>Executing this script in my laptop took something like 11 seconds&hellip; that is a lot for a 57 files markdown-to-html
convertion.
It is way too much. I wrote the same thing <a href="https://gist.github.com/pcarranza/da11a10e03c3ba1641ad#file-convert-rb">using ruby all along</a>.
This second implementation took less than a second in execution time.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it, I got distracted.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There was an old project, it started based on an ancient ppc ubuntu that was running on top of a mac mini G4, built for python 2.4 in an environment that did not accepted installing any dependency.</p>

<p>Back in the day I did not knew what a unit test was, so I built it the old way: code a little, try it, code a little more, make it work again, etc, etc.
You can tell if you see the old code, it is full with logging messages to check if the execution reach a certain portion of the code, oh yeah, no debugging was possible.</p>

<p>In the middle of the road, rhythmbox evolved, with <a href="http://www.gnome.org/gnome-3/">gnome-shell</a> rhythmbox adapted to <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK3</a>, breaking a lot of things.
And finally it also changed from python2 to python3, breaking the rest of things.</p>

<p>There is a lot of work to do to bring it back.</p>

<p>The way I use it is by turning my mobile phone into a remote control for my music player: <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Rhythmbox">rhythmbox</a>,
 that way I can select what I want to hear without turning on the screen on my HTPC or reaching a keyboard, both things I&rsquo;m not usually able to, and also I am lazy.</p>
